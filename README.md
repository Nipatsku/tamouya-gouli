# Concept

Web site which shows "results":
- Input word
    * User selects language of input speech (optional?)
    * If specified, program will use speech to text to display input text.
- List of output results
    * Show flags?
    * Finnish translation as well as local text
- Once a day, when server is connected, allows inputting a word (via Microphone).
    * Afterwards redeployment is necessary.
